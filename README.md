# Day Planner

## Purpose
This project was another homework assignment for my bootcamp. I have decided to go back through the course material to keep my skills sharp. The great thing about this is that I can go through these projects and assess my progress.

## Process
This project has actually been a huge confidence booster. I ran into only two real problems. I solved both with relative ease. Before I get to those, I must first say, after looking back on my old code, I realize I actually went in and manipulated the html which, in hind site, was not the point. The point was to use jquery to dynamically render elements. One of the hardest parts of the code was disecting the provided css to figure out exactly how the wanted the DOM constucted using prebuilt classes. As I mentioned the focus was on utilizing jQuery. The Biggest issue I had was with an if statement that kept breaking the code. I realized the issue had to do with me forgetting to parseInt() a value. Silly mistake but lesson learned. As I mentioned this has been a really big confidence booster to see how far not only my skills have come, but also how my mindeset regarding the process has become.
